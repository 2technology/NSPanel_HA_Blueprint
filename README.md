# NSPanel Custom with HA Blueprint
Custom Firmware for NsPanel (esphome) and HA Blueprint with configuration of button, light settings, colorwheel, colortemp, cover, weather preview, automatic TFT upload etc.

Why another version for the NSPanel? 
Well - all versions I've seen (except @joBr99s version) have been missing something everywhere. 
That's why I decided to create something myself.


# GOAL:
My goal was to create a version that could be quickly adopted for multiple NSPanels.
In addition, the configuration should be as simple as possible.

Therefore I decided to put most of it into a HA Blueprint. This makes it possible to quickly and easily assign keys to the NSPanel or to exchange key programming.

In addition, another NSPanel can be configured very quickly. But have a look yourself ;)
